# homecc
This was an early prototype of a server written in Python that I used for home automation. 
I have since changed a lot of what is being used and for security purposes will not be maintaining this repo anymore.


* Home security system that consists of:
    - Home Command Center server
    - Speaker interface
    - Door sensor interface
    - Camera interface
